              Meet Gurjant Singh, your Backend Coding Craftsman! ðŸš€ With a year
              immersed in coding realms, I specialize in backend brilliance.
              Proficient in Express.js, I architect robust APIs that power
              seamless interactions. Node.js is my playground for
              high-performance server-side magic, while Next.js fuels my
              curiosity for dynamic applications. From optimizing data flow to
              ensuring top-notch security, I engineer solutions that align code
              with functionality. Let's code the future togetherâ€”one efficient
              API at a time.
